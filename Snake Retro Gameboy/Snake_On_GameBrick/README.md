This is the main code for our ECE 4760 Final Project: Snake/GameBrick. The main program file is at TFT_PIO.c
This is a fully functional version of Snake with dynamic difficulty and persistent score storage. The whole project runs on a raspberry pi pico board and is connected with external buttons, speakers, and FRAM modules on a customly designed handheld gaming device
