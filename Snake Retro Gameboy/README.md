## Learn More About the Project

My final project for ECE 4760, titled Snake on “GameBrick,” recreates the classic arcade game Snake on a fully portable, retro-style handheld console inspired by the original Game Boy. The device combines both hardware and software elements, built around a Raspberry Pi Pico, with a TFT display, SPI FRAM, and PWM-based audio output, to create a nostalgic yet modern embedded gaming experience.

The project webpage includes:
- A full technical write-up and system overview
- Block diagrams, control-flow charts, and hardware schematics
- A demo video showcasing gameplay and design features
