# 16-Channel Servo Controller Board

## Overview
This custom board is a servo controller that can run up to 16 independent servo motors. Each motor is controlled by accurate hardware PWM signals generated by the STM32. The system runs off a 28-volt power input, which is regulated on the board to provide power for both the logic circuits and the shared servo power rail.
